 ### What is the Planning Phase?
 - It is the first phase of building any product and the most important. 
 - This phase answers all of the questions:
    1. How should the product look?
    2. How should it feel?
    3. What should it do?
    4. What are the client(s) goals?
    5. What are the user(s) goals?
    6. What are the defined goals that you want the product to achieve?

 ### What is the Design Phase?
 - It is the 2nd phase and it's about using information from planning phase and turning it into real designs/aesthetics. 
 - Real designs as in site structure, mobile structure, visual representation (what the users see?)
 - When the design phase is completed, we should know the answers to the following questions:
    1. What should the product look like?
    2. What should the product do?

 ### What is the Development Phase?
 - The 3rd phase of product design. It is where we actually code/program the functionality of the application and turn designs into live website or mobile app.
 - It uses assets and info from the design phase to turn into live application (web or mobile)
 - Utilize HTML, CSS, JS, Frameworks, Testing Frameworks, HTTP Frameworks, CI/CD Tools, etc.

 ### What is the Launch Phase?
 - The 4th phase where we deliver our product to the users AKA the public.
 - We still make some design tweaks, or test the app to ensure the core features are working as expected.

 <a id="item-five"></a>
### What is the post-launch phase?
- This is the last phase where we hand off the product to the client.
- We also monitor/watch how the launch goes to learn the following:
    1. How do the users use the product?
    2. Are there any issues?
- No product works 100% right from the beginning hence this phase. We do user testing to
learn what works and what does not.
- After learning from insights, We go back to phase 1 with the same product to improve it and repeat until we get the level of quality we want from the app!

### Where do designers end and developers begin?

| Role      | Responsibility |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Designers | <ul><li>Post-Launch</li><li>Visual Design</li><li>Planning</li></ul> |
| Developers | <ul><li>Development</li><li>Launch</li><li>Post-Launch</li></ul> |

- Designers and Developers should not limit themselves to the phases here within the table. It helps to learn about the other phases outside of immediate responsibility to contribute more effectively to the product's development!
