### Use Cases Between Groups and Frames
- Frames are great for many use cases
    - Scaling a frame in figma causes a reaction like the shapes/elements are being clipped when dimensions are changed

- Groups
  - Shapes b/c when you scale it, All content within the group share the same scaled dimensions

  - Keep size of larger group

  - Good for logos, and little elements

### How to ungroup Groups

- Ungroup using `ctrl + shift + G` like ungrouping a frame

NOTE: `ctrl + backspace` = ungroup

#### Exercise 2

In figma, make a frame and a group and scale them up and down. Observe there behavior.

Note: Use `clip content` for the framed elements to better visualize it's behavior when resized!
