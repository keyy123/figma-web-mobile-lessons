# Community Files

## How to access community file?
- From the home dashboard in figma, Click 'Community'

- This is where we can find plugins, files, and other resources to make our designs for our product real!
    - Like the vscode extension tab and github made a child product that focuses on designs. 

- Why do we go to community files?
    - We want to re-use assets b/c like development, design is not about creating new things from scratch but effectively re-using existing tools and modifying it as needed to suit our purposes.

- 2 ways to find things:
    1. Search bar (like google)
    2. Look at trending files 

- After clicking on a file you like, if you can:
    1. Look at file wihout downloading
    2. Duplicate file and have a copy that you can change completely
