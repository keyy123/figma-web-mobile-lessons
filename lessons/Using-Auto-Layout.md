# Using Auto-Layout

- `Ctrl + R` = Rename selected frames/layers 

### How to create an auto-layout frame?
1. Select a frame (not a layer!!!)

2. In Right Sidebar within the design panel, Click the âž• button next to `Auto Layout`

- [Ok, maybe not exactly next to it but you know what I mean](../assets/auto-layout.png)

- Now, you have an auto-layout frame!

NOTE: If you try this on normal layers, It won't work at all! This works on frames ONLY. `ctrl + alt + g`

### Auto-Layout vs Regular Frame
- Auto-layout frames are useful if
    - You want responsiveness built into the frame
    - You can re-organize the frames within an auto-layout fast using arrow or click and drag
    - Like flexbox, You can quickly change orientation of items easily
    - Good for making nice lists, buttons, etc.

- [auto-layouts expands responsively to addition of new frames. Reg does not...](../assets/auto-vs-reg.png)

#### Exercise 1:

Create 2 new frames and make 1 an auto-layout frame.

Duplicate rectangles within it and notice the frames behavior (normal vs auto). Try different properties and orientations
