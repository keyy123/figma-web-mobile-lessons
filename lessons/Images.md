 ### How to add images to our file?
 - Plugins (will explain later)
 1. Copy & Pasting (Easiest)
    - `Ctrl + C` (Copy)
    - `Ctrl + V` (Paste)
    - You can copy images (and other figma elements) from one file to another easily 
    - 
 2. Drag & Drop 
    - Drag file directly from desktop or file explorer into figma canvas
    - This include frames, groups, elements, assets

 3. Import image via file explorer (locally)
    - Select the shape tool and select `place image` option
    - [Place Image Location](../assets/Place-image-topbar.png)

 ### How to edit images in our file?
 - You can edit an image like other element (shapes, groups, frames, etc.)

 - If you resize it, You'll see that images kinda work like frames in the sense that it does not scale but fills the container and looks clipped when shortened

 - Using `shift` and resizing an image scales the image and keeps aspect ratio the same

 - It uses same frame properties like other elements (X, Y, W, H, Angle, Border Radius, Layer, etc.)

 #### Fill Properties for images
 - In the right sidebar under `Fill` section, Click Image and you should see `Fill` next to a dropdown
 <br/>
 - [Fill Options For Images](../assets/fill-image-options.png)
 <br/>
 1. Fill = Fill up the available space (w+H) using the image
 <br/>

 2. Fit = fit the entire image regardless of the dimensions AND keep the original aspect ratio of the image.
 <br/>

 3. Crop = Remove a subsection of the image BUT it's not keeping the same aspect ratio for the newly changed image and it's looks weird
 <br/>

 4. Tile = Makes a collage of same image with no effects applied!

 - There are other image options like Exposure, Contrast, Saturation, Temperature, Tint, etc to add customization to image.
 <br/>

- [Other Image Effects](../assets/Other-Image-Options.png)

Figma even has a blend mode that allows us to create photoshop-like effects to create awesome images

- [Blend Mode Menu](../assets/blend-mode-effects-menu.png)

 ### Customizing the fill
 <br/>
- While an image or element is still selected, In the Fill section, Click the + sign lets us add a new layer to our image which can be gradients or other things to the element
