 ### Be Prepared
- Prepare sketching tools before starting (paper, pens, tools, even tablets)
- Establish clear goals (What are your goals? Certain flow or interaction)
- Who is my audience? (Explain thought process and explanations between sketches to avoid losing time)
- Always use a timer (time box) for sketching, idea generation, and even presentation

 ### Ready, Set, Go
- Just get stared

1. Draw a frame for the intended device/platform you are designing the application for 

2. Draw simple repeating elements used across most or all views and focus on big picture ideas 

3. Move on to more detailed interactions/fxns
 - Use simple shapes to design interactions but still keep it simple but with some more details
 - Squares, Rectangles, Circles, Lines and even triangles are all you need to do this

 - Add notes to your sketches and store them safely for later

4. Keep going
 - Keep iterating on the sketches you think have potential to be great views and share with team to discuss 
 - Collect feedback and iterate on sketches

 ### Refinement
 - How to clean up successful but messy sketches?

 1. Add titles to your sketches to add context to sketch

 2. Add notes to add more context to sketches

 3. Use numbers to make it easier to follow along

 4. Use Arrows to add context for interactions or transitions
