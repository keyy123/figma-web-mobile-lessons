### 2-step sketching

![Sketching Process](/assets/2-step-sketching.png "Sketching Process")

1. Generate (Idea Generation) & Sketch

   - Approach a new product and create as many ideas as you can
   - It's normal to be missing some ideas/elements/details BUT focus on getting ideas out quickly. Focus on quantity then pick the idea(s) that solve the tasks you want done effectively.
   - Sketch out ideas

2. Add Details & Refinement

   - Work on adding more details over time
   - Some ideas or alot of them are stopped and rejected at this stage which is fine but
      overtime the successful ideas will grow more and more detailed as you continue
      to iterate over time.

### Idea generation to refinement

1. Steps in Idea Generations
  a. Ideas (sketching)
   - Sketching out low-fidelity/low-detail designs with pencil and paper or software
   - Usually, no colors or some for key parts of sketch
   - Main goal is to draw many basic sketches AND more importantly, don't get tied down by details or commit to any option yet...

 b. Wireframes
  - Create wireframes of sketches to add more details to basic sketch from step 1
  - The more successful basic sketches develop into potentially promising views
  - The wireframe won't have all of the details BUT that is fine. It will have many vital details which are added to refine basic sketches such as ui elements,

c. Components
  - After wireframing is done, We refine wireframe sketches and start focusing on certain UI elements that are used across sketches
  - This can include different form inputs, states, content, and buttons
